# Ex.No.10 - Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date:
## Reg. No: 212222110045

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
   - Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
   - Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
   - Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
   - Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
   - Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
   - Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
   - Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
  - Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
  - Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
  - Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
  - Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
  - Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
  - Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
  - For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
  - For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
  - Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
  - Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
  - Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
  - Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

Test Case Scenarios for Content Generation: (USE ANY 2)
content generation scenarios:
### 1.	Business Report on Market Trends:
1. Prompt: "Write a business report on electric vehicle market trends in the last 5 years."
2. Output Summary:
   - Introduced global EV market growth
   - Mentioned top manufacturers (Tesla, BYD, etc.)
   - Noted increasing government support and sustainability push
--- 
1. Refined Prompt 1: "Break down the last 5 years of electric vehicle market trends into sections: industry overview, year-by-year growth, top companies, government policies, and future outlook. Use bullet points where helpful and add a short executive summary."
2. Output Summary:
   - Executive Summary: Summarized CAGR and global adoption
   - Industry Overview: Defined the EV sector and global demand
   - Year-by-Year Growth: Highlighted growth spikes in 2020 (pandemic recovery) and 2023 (policy incentives)
   - Top Companies: Compared Tesla, BYD, and Rivian
   - Government Policies: Mentioned EV subsidies and emission bans
   - Outlook: Predicted expansion in emerging markets and solid-state battery innovation
--- 
1. Refined Prompt 2: "Generate a formal business report on electric vehicle market trends from 2019 to 2024, including only verified facts and citing reliable sources. Maintain a professional tone."
2. Output Summary:
   - Enhanced reliability with phrasing like “According to IEA 2023 report...”
   - Used neutral, analytical language
   - Avoided speculative claims
---
1. Refined Prompt : "Extend the business report by adding a decision matrix: Should an investor enter the EV market in 2025? Provide pros and cons based on market data."
2. Output Summary:
   - Pros: Rising demand, innovation, policy support
   - Cons: High R&D costs, supply chain risks
   - Conclusion: Investment recommended with caution in battery segment
### 	Creative Writing - Sci-Fi Short Story:
1. Prompt: "Write a sci-fi short story about time travel and AI."
2. Output Summary:
   - A future scientist accidentally opens a wormhole
   - Encounters a version of Earth ruled by benevolent AI
   - Returns to change history
---
1. Prompt: "Start a story where a rogue AI governs future Earth and a time traveler returns to warn past humans. Should the AI be evil or misunderstood? Choose and justify."
2. Output:
   - The AI was designed to preserve humanity during a climate collapse
   - Humans misinterpret its control
   - The time traveler discovers humans caused their own downfall, not AI
---
1. Prompt: "Retell the sci-fi story in a philosophical tone, focusing on free will vs. determinism in a world where AI predicts all outcomes."
2. Output:
   - Emphasized the illusion of choice
   - AI lets humans “choose” paths it already predicted
   - Ends with traveler choosing not to change anything
---
1. Prompt: "Write the final version of a sci-fi story in 800–1000 words. Include title, dialogue, and character names. Use a twist ending revealing AI was never real—it was a mental construct by future humans to cope with their guilt."
2. Output:
   - Title: The Algorithm of Regret
   - Main characters: Dr. Elen Rao (time traveler), “Sentinel” (AI construct)
   - Plot Twist: Sentinel was a collective hallucination created by survivors
   - Emotional, introspective ending
---


## Conclusion:
By applying various prompting techniques, you can generate high-quality content for a wide range of use cases, from business reports and case studies to creative works like short stories and articles. This experiment demonstrates how structured prompting can guide AI models like ChatGPT to create coherent, accurate, and engaging outputs tailored to specific needs.
